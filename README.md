# Personal Expenses Tracker
> Created in Fall 2020. Written in Python.

## Project Overview
An interactive GUI that helps track and visualize all transactions (i.e., withdrawals/deposits).

## Features
- GUI and visual graphs are supported by Tkinter and matlibplot modules, respectively
- Database stores transaction records and retrieves relevant records through SQLite3 queries
- Allows users to cancel a transcation and return to the Main Menu at any time

## Visual Demo
- todo

## Acknowledgments
This was an independent project. All visual demos and sample resources (such as the database instance) were also created by myself. While writing the source code, I relied on various online tutorials, documentations, and examples. Through this project, I learned about and applied the modules above for the first time. 

> Lastly, this README is in progress.
